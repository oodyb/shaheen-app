        This project addresses the complex task consumers face when trying to
        find the best prices across multiple e-commerce platforms. With the
        rapid expansion of online marketplaces, finding optimal deals can be
        overwhelming and time-consuming. Our solution, a price comparison tool,
        enables users to search for specific products and provides a
        comprehensive, real-time overview of prices from trusted platforms like
        Virgin, Starlink, and others. Key features of our tool include an
        intuitive interface, effective web-scraping mechanisms for reliable data
        retrieval, and real-time updates to reflect market fluctuations. By
        automating the process of comparing prices, we offer users greater
        purchasing power and a streamlined shopping experience. Our solution
        further enables price trend analysis, allowing consumers to make
        informed purchasing decisions based on historical data. In addition to
        price comparison, our tool incorporates a machine learning
        recommendation algorithm, which represents the innovative core of our
        solution. By analyzing past user behavior, preferences, and purchasing
        patterns, the recommendation model suggests alternative products or
        better deals that align with the userâ€™s specific interests. This
        predictive feature not only enhances the personalization of the shopping
        experience but also guides users toward more cost-effective or
        higher-quality options based on intelligent recommendations. Through the
        successful development and testing of this tool, we demonstrate the
        feasibility of implementing automated price comparison functionalities
        at scale. Key achievements include accurate and efficient data
        extraction, robust recommendation capabilities, and enhanced user
        satisfaction due to personalized suggestions. This solution empowers
        consumers to make informed purchasing decisions, promotes transparency,
        and fosters a more cost-conscious approach to online shopping.
